# Structural-Protein-Sequences  
## **Project:**     
In this project, we examined the structural properties of proteins. The project contains various data preprocessing techniques to analyze and clean a dataset. 
### **About The Dataset:**      
The dataset is about structural protein sequences that has been retrieved from
Research Colloboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank
(PDB) and kindly aknowledged.
The dataset contains protein meta data which includes details on protein
classification, extraction methods, etc.
